    "text": "This is a collection of use cases for using KNIME in doing research in Chinese Studies. The documentation is in English and Chinese. This is the deliverable for the 2022 KNIME Teaching Award I received from KNIME AG. I greatly appreciate the support from KNIME AG, especially Aline Bessa, for her patience and support.\n\n\nThis site provides a collection of use cases for using KNIME in doing research in Chinese Studies. It would not cover every aspect of KNIME, as it is a very broad topic. Here are some useful resources for getting started:\n\nThe complete documentation for KNIME: https://docs.knime.com.\nKNIMETV: https://www.youtube.com/@KNIMETV\nLinkedIn Learning: Low Code/No-Code Data Literacy with KNIME: From Basic to Advanced\n\nOnce you are familiar with the basics of KNIME, you can get started with the use cases in this site.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the KNIME download page. Navigate to the KNIME website’s download page.\nSelect the macOS download option. On the download page, find and click the installation option for macOS. KNIME supports macOS versions 12 (Monterey)and above, for both x86_64 Intel and M1 (arm64 - Apple silicon). Note that only the last two major versions are supported.\nAccept the terms and conditions. Read and agree to the privacy policy and terms and conditions, then click “Download”.\nLocate the downloaded file. Once the download is complete, find the downloaded .dmg file.\nOpen the .dmg file. Double click the downloaded .dmg file and wait for the verification process to finish.\nMove the KNIME icon to Applications. Drag the KNIME icon to your Applications folder.\nLaunch KNIME. Double-click the KNIME icon in the Applications folder to start KNIME Analytics Platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the download page on the KNIME website.\nOn the download page, find the “Download KNIME” tab.\nSelect the installation option that fits your operating system (Windows). You can choose between the Windows installer, the self-extracting archive, or the zip archive.\n\nThe Windows installer will extract the installation folder, add an icon to your desktop, and suggest suitable memory settings.\nThe self-extracting archive will create a folder containing the KNIME installation files without needing any special software.\nThe zip archive will allow you to download, save, and extract the files to a location of your choice.\n\nRead and accept the privacy policy and terms and conditions, and then click “Download”.\nOnce the download is complete, proceed with the installation:\n\nIf you downloaded the installer or self-extracting archive, run the downloaded file.\nIf you downloaded the zip archive, unpack it to a location of your choice. Then, run knime.exe to start KNIME Analytics Platform.\n\nKNIME Analytics Platform will launch. You may be asked if you want to share your usage statistics with KNIME. No personal information will be shared, and the statistics will be used to improve the Workflow Coach.\nThe “Workspace Launcher” window will appear, where you need to specify the path for your workspace. The workspace is a folder where all your preferences and workflows will be saved. The default workspace folder is ..-workspace, but you can change it."
